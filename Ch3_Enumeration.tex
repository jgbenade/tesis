Chapter 3 will give an overview of the main equivalence classes of \lat s and motivate why the decision was made to focus only on enumerating main classes. Some examples of existing enumeration techniques for MOLS will be described, after which an algorithm for the enumeration of main classes will be designed.  The algorithm will be verified by comparing its results with previously published findings.
