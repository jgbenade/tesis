To test if everthing is working:
================================

Set up biber according to "Biber Setup.pdf".

Everytime you change something in your bibliography, do the following:

* Compile to pdf or ps (as you wish)
* Run biber
* Compile again

In order to verify that everything is working correctly, check whether your output matches the file "thesis.pdf".

Check the "ORiON Bibliography Style.pdf" to see how to typeset your .bib file. There are examples in bibliography.bib.
