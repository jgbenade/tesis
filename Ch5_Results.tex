Chapter 5 will contain details pertaining to the method of deploying a small-scale distributed search based on the design set out in Chapter 4 as a proof of concept.  It will include how awareness of the project was raised in the scientific community, the  challenges involved in launching the project as well as the lessons learnt for the possible future deployment of larger scale projects.  The chapter will conclude with the results of the distributed computing project designed in Chapter 4, most likely the enumeration of main classes of MOLS of order 8 or 9.  It will also give a summary of the distributed enumeration in terms of number of volunteers, locality, how work was done by each of the volunteers etc.
